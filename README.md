📘 Working with Text Data
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates essential techniques in handling and processing text data using Python. 
It is tailored for tasks in natural language processing (NLP), including text preprocessing, tokenization, 
vocabulary building, and working with Torchtext and PyTorch.

🚀 Key Features
Text preprocessing and tokenization

Vocabulary creation and encoding

Handling special tokens (e.g., <PAD>, <UNK>)

Using Torchtext for data pipelines

Preparing text for training deep learning models

🛠️ Requirements
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch torchtext matplotlib
